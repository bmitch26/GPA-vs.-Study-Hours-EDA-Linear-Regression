# GPA vs. Study Hours EDA + Linear-Regression
The following dataset includes 193 students at a university,
their grade point averages(GPA), and hours studied per week.
An exploratory data analysis(EDA) and linear regression
model is created to see to see if there is a relationship 
between these two variables. At the end of experimentation,
it is determined that there is a slight positive correlation
between hours studied and GPA.
